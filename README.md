# COP-4530-Project-1
This assignment will provide practice with a templated vector class, along with practice on the basic concept of an iterator over a container.

# Task
For this assignment you will implement a templated class NSequence (New Sequence). It is similar
to Vector but with a different set of member functions. NSequence can take a primitive data type as its
item, such as int, string, or other class types, such as IntCell as discussed in class.
